<h1>NeoEMF : A Multi-database Model Persistence Framework.</h1>

<p>The figure below describes the integration of NeoEMF in the Eclipse-based EMF ecosystem,
    the most popular modeling framework nowadays. Modelers typically access a model using
    <i>Model-based Tools</i>, which provide high-level modeling features such as a graphical
    interface, interactive console, or query editor. These features internally rely on EMF's
    <i>Model Access API</i> to navigate models, perform CRUD operations, check constraints, etc.
    At its core, EMF delegates the operations to a persistence manager using its
    <i>Persistence API</i>, which is in charge of the (de)serialization of the model.
    The NeoEMF <i>core</i> component is defined at this level, and can be registered as a
    persistence manager for EMF, replacing, for instance, the default XMI persistence manager.
    This design makes NeoEMF both transparent to the client-application and EMF itself,
    that simply delegates the calls without taking care of the actual storage.</p>

<p>Once the NeoEMF <i>core</i> component has received the request of the modeling operation
    to perform, it forwards the operation to the appropriate database driver (<i>MapDB</i>, <i>Blueprints</i>,
    or <i>HBase</i>), which is in charge of handling the low-level representation of the model.
    These connectors translate modeling operations into <i>Backend API</i> calls, store the results,
    and reify database records into EMF <i>EObjects</i> when needed. NeoEMF also embeds a set of
    default caching strategies that are used to improve performance of client applications, and can
    be configured transparently at the EMF API level.</p>

    <p>Each backend is provided in a dedicated Eclipse plugin. you can navigate through the documentation
        to have a complete overview of backend-specific classes and how they interact with the <i>core</i> component.
        NeoEMF provides 4 database adapters for now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blueprints - TinkerGraph: the default graph database embedded in Blueprints</li>
        <li>Blueprints - Neo4j: Neo4j graph database under the Blueprints API</li>
        <li>MapDB: an in-memory/on-disk Map database</li>
        <li>HBase: a distributed Column database</li>
    </ul>
